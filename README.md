# Fourier

Fourier is a code-summary application that uses natural language processing techniques to summarize code into human readable phrases. It is a simple tool that is designed to increase the speed at which developers learn and understand code written by others.

Fourier is not meant to replace the human reader, but to augment them. This tool hopefully makes decoding programming languages and convoluted code bases a lot easier and less time-intensive.


## Features

1) Fourier reads code snippets and translates them into spoken language that is summarized and contextualized.
2) Users can click on summaries to highlights which pieces of code the generated text is referring to.
3) Summaries will have multiple layers to give users access to multiple "zoom depths" of the code's logic details.

## Long Term Goals
1) Generate web-publishable code summaries


## What Fourier is not

Fourier is not an technical documentation auto-generator. Its purpose is not to take in commented code and generate formatted documentation from the comments and code snippets (although, this may become a feature eventually). Fourier is designed simply to read programming languages and translate them into spoken language, with or without comments or parameter definitions from the developer.
