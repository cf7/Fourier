# Fourier

Fourier is a code-summary application that uses natural language processing techniques to summarize code into human readable phrases.


## Features

1) Fourier reads code snippets and translates them into spoken language that is summarized and contextualized.
2) Users can click on summaries to highlights which pieces of code the generated text is referring to.
3) Summaries will have multiple layers to give users access to multiple "zoom depths" of the code's logic details.

## Long Term Goals
1) Generate web-publishable technical documentation for code
