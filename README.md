# Fourier

Fourier is a sandbox interface that I built specifically to demonstrate my frontend proficiencies for potential employers. It was originally intended for a NLP source code summarizer project . . . until I ran into a project-killing hurdle. (You can read about that [here](https://github.com/cf7/Fourier/blob/main/docs/original_README.md))


 There are several things that are true about the Fourier interface:

 1) It's features are completely arbitrary
 2) The model doing the translations is just as rudimentary.
