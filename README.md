# Fourier
Fourier is a sandbox interface that I built specifically to demonstrate my web development proficiencies for potential employers.

*Note: In the spirit of learning, I did not use `create-react-app` for this project. It is built from scratch.*

It was originally intended for a NLP source code summarizer project . . . until I ran into a project-killing hurdle.\
(You can read about that [here](https://github.com/cf7/Fourier/blob/main/docs/original_README.md).)

Check out the demo for the app through the link below:\
(Almost mobile-friendly.)\

For translating written text, Fourier uses a Sequence-to-Sequence neural network with LSTM layers, the code for which is featured on my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cf1111/fourier4).
