# Fourier
Fourier is a sandbox interface that I built specifically to demonstrate my frontend proficiencies for potential employers.

It was originally intended for a NLP source code summarizer project . . . until I ran into a project-killing hurdle.\
(You can read about that [here](https://github.com/cf7/Fourier/blob/main/docs/original_README.md).)

Check out the demo for the app through the link below:\
